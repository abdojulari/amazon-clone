### Amazon Clone <br />
## Amazon clone with ReactJs , ExpressJs with Firstore, Stripe etc <br />

This isn't actually an Amazon platform but a clone, just to imitate the functionalities of the real amazon e-commerce. <br />

# DISCLAIMER: I am not responsible for anything done with the app, I followed a "5 days Amazon clone", it is for learning purpose and I was able to come up with this. I learned and would be able to transfer the skills to build a real other related applications.


NOTE: All the keys would be removed, you can go ahead and generate yours by following some tutorials on Stripe, Firestore/firebase connection, Express etc. 

You can take a look at this. <br />
